Allow ${HOME} in .npmrc to work in Windows (#4693)

* Allow ${HOME} in .npmrc to work in Windows

Windows doesn't set the HOME environment variable by default, but NPM
has logic to set process.env.HOME based on the current OS home
directory.  See
https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/fb28e5868a9dbbe21a15f23fe8cf8b3703e8adf2/lib/config/defaults.js#L81

Yarn doesn't do this, so configs such as `prefix =
${HOME}/.npm-packages` that work for NPM will cause Yarn to refuse to
run.  This commit updates Yarn's behavior to be closer to NPM's.

Unlike NPM, this commit only sets HOME if it's not already set, to avoid
potentially incompatible changes with existing Yarn users.

Yarn doesn't do this, so configs such as `prefix =
${HOME}/.npm-packages` that work for NPM will cause Yarn to refuse to
run.  This commit updates Yarn's behavior to be closer to NPM's, by
using a custom/modified environment when processing NPM configurations.

Add a Flow type `Env` to represent a set of environment variables.

* Ensure environment is restored after test

(A separate `describe` block seems like overkill.)
