fix(resolver): Fix incorrect peer dependency res. from different trees (#4687)

**Summary**

Fixes #4539, fixes #1234, fixes #234.     Yarn was resolving peer dependencies from the closest level where the peer dependency
was requested
but it was not checking if the peer dependency was in the same subtree. This was causing incorrect
peer dependency resolutions and package duplication when  an unrelated subtree has a depedency
satisfying the required peer dependency at the same tree level.


```js
var some = 'code sample';
some.replace('to see', 'if serializer');


breaks(some);
```


**Test plan**

Added new install integration test that fails without the fix.

**Breaking changes**

So many breaing changes that I cannot list
